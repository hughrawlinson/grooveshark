# Grooveshark JS

## Grooveshark doesn't exist anymore, don't use this package.

This was a quick 'n dirty JS wrapper for the Grooveshark API, which sadly doesn't exist anymore.

## Usage

Don't.

## License

## Thanks
* The folks at Grooveshark for giving me an API key. Much appreciated.
* The makers of the fine packages that are Request and Crypto.
